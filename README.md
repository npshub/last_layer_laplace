# Important!

LLLA, among other Laplace-approximation flavors are available in the easy-to-use `laplace-torch` library: <https://github.com/AlexImmer/Laplace>.

Please use that library instead of this code repository!

# Last-layer Laplace approximation (LLLA)

Code examples of the last-layer Laplace approximation method used in "Being Bayesian, Even Just a Bit, Fixes Overconfidence in ReLU Networks" paper (ICML 2020). See `bnn_laplace.ipynb` and `bnn_laplace_multiclass.ipynb`. Codes for reproducing the paper's results are in the `paper` directory.
